# Water-Quality-Prediction


This project aims to predict the quality of water using machine learning based on key metrics such as oxygen level, nitrate, sulphate, suspended particles, and more. The water is then classified into different quality levels like safe, moderate, or unsafe.

## Predicted Water Quality Parameters

The model predicts multiple water quality parameters such as:

- NH4
- BOD5 (BSK5)
- Colloids
- O2, NO3, NO2, SO4, PO4 and 
- CL
